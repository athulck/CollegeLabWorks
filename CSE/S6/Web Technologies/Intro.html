				<h3>The world wide web</h3>
				<blockquote>
		The World Wide Web allows computer users to execute web-based applications and to
	locate and view multimedia-based documents on almost any subject over the Internet. The
	web is a relatively recent creation. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee of CERN (the European Or-
	ganization for Nuclear Research) began to develop a technology for sharing information
	via hyperlinked text documents. Berners-Lee called his invention the HyperText Markup
	Language (HTML). He also wrote communication protocols to form the backbone of his
	new information system, which he called the World Wide Web. In particular, he wrote
	the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)â€”a communications protocol used to send in-
	formation over the web. The URL (Uniform Resource Locator) specifies the address (i.e.,
	location) of the web page displayed in the browser window. Each web page on the Internet
	is associated with a unique URL.

				<h3>The Web and The Internet</h3>
				<blockquote>
		It is important to understand that the Internet and the Web are not the same
	thing. The Internet is a collection of computers and other devices connected by
	equipment that allows them to communicate with each other. The Web is a col-
	lection of software and protocols that has been installed on most, if not all, of the
	computers on the Internet. Some of these computers run Web servers, which pro-
	vide documents, but most run Web clients, or browsers, which request documents
	from servers and display them to users. The Internet was quite useful before the
	Web was developed, and it is still useful without it. However, most users of the
	Internet now use it through the Web.

				<h3>Web Servers</h3>
				<blockquote>
					The file structure of a Web server has two separate directories. The root of
				one of these is the document root. The file hierarchy that grows from the document
				root stores the Web documents to which the server has direct access and normally
				serves to clients. The root of the other directory is the server root. This directory,
				along with its descendant directories, stores the server and its support software.

				<pre>
					Document Root : /var/www/html/
				</pre>

				<h3>MIME-Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension</h3>
				<blockquote>
					When the browser receives the document from a Web server, it uses the included MIME
					format specification to determine what to do with the document.
					MIME specifications have the following form:
					<pre>type/subtype</pre>
					The most common MIME types are text , image , and video . The most
					common text subtypes are plain and html . Some common image subtypes are
					gif and jpeg . Some common video subtypes are mpeg and quicktime . A list
					of MIME specifications is stored in the configuration files of every Web server.
					In the remainder of this book, when we say document type, we mean both the type
					and subtype of the document.

					The name of an experimental sub-type begins with x-
